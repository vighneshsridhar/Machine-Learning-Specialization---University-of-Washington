We can also model this data with a mixture of Gaussians, though with increasing dimension we run into two important issues associated with using a full covariance matrix for each component.\n"," * Computational cost becomes prohibitive in high dimensions: score calculations have complexity cubic in the number of dimensions M if the Gaussian has a full covariance matrix.\n"," * A model with many parameters require more data: observe that a full covariance matrix for an M-dimensional Gaussian will have M(M+1)/2 parameters to fit. With the number of parameters growing roughly as the square of the dimension, it may quickly become impossible to find a sufficient amount of data to make good inferences.\n","\n","Both of these issues are avoided if we require the covariance matrix of each component to be diagonal, as then it has only M parameters to fit and the score computation decomposes into M univariate score calculations. Recall from the lecture that the M-step for the full covariance is:\n","\n","\\begin{align*}\n","\\hat{\\Sigma}_k &= \\frac{1}{N_k^{soft}} \\sum_{i=1}^N r_{ik} (x_i-\\hat{\\mu}_k)(x_i - \\hat{\\mu}_k)^T\n","\\end{align*}\n","\n","Note that this is a square matrix with M rows and M columns, and the above equation implies that the (v, w) element is computed by\n","\n","\\begin{align*}\n","\\hat{\\Sigma}_{k, v, w} &= \\frac{1}{N_k^{soft}} \\sum_{i=1}^N r_{ik} (x_{iv}-\\hat{\\mu}_{kv})(x_{iw} - \\hat{\\mu}_{kw})\n","\\end{align*}\n","\n","When we assume that this is a diagonal matrix, then non-diagonal elements are assumed to be zero and we only need to compute each of the M elements along the diagonal independently using the following equation. \n","\n","\\begin{align*}\n","\\hat{\\sigma}^2_{k, v} &= \\hat{\\Sigma}_{k, v, v}  \\\\\n","&= \\frac{1}{N_k^{soft}} \\sum_{i=1}^N r_{ik} (x_{iv}-\\hat{\\mu}_{kv})^2\n","\\end{align*}\n","\n","In this section, we will use an EM implementation to fit a Gaussian mixture model with **diagonal** covariances to a subset of the Wikipedia dataset.

This means any data point with one of those words will have 0 probability of being assigned to that cluster since the cluster allows for no variability (0 variance) around that count being 0 (0 mean). Since there is a small chance for those words to later appear in the cluster, we instead assign a small positive variance (~1e-10). Doing so also prevents numerical overflow.\n"," \n","We provide the complete implementation for you in the file `em_utilities.py`.

With a bad initial set of means, EM may produce clusters that span a large area and are mostly overlapping. To eliminate such bad outcomes, we first produce a suitable set of initial means by using the cluster centers from running k-means.  That is, we first run k-means and then take the final set of means from the converged solution as the initial means in our EM algorithm."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"4fzrmRDp8NZn","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1635987019589,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":145636,"user":{"displayName":"Vighnesh Sridhar","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"07506833859532900314"}},"outputId":"a1fc3e11-14df-49eb-8bc8-1345d623ae69"},"source":["%%time \n","\n","from sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n","\n","np.random.seed(5)\n","num_clusters = 25\n","\n","# Use scikit-learn's k-means to simplify workflow\n","#kmeans_model = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, n_init=5, max_iter=400, random_state=1, n_jobs=-1) # uncomment to use parallelism -- may break on your installation\n","kmeans_model = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, n_init=5, max_iter=400, random_state=1, n_jobs=1)\n","kmeans_model.fit(tf_idf)\n","centroids, cluster_assignment = kmeans_model.cluster_centers_, kmeans_model.labels_\n","\n","means = [centroid for centroid in centroids]"],"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["CPU times: user 2min 28s, sys: 15 s, total: 2min 43s\n","Wall time: 2min 25s\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kP9bYCXi8NZo"},"source":["**Initializing cluster weights**\n","\n","We will initialize each cluster weight to be the proportion of documents assigned to that cluster by k-means above."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"XFB9XNa78NZo","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1635987024928,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":199,"user":{"displayName":"Vighnesh Sridhar","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"07506833859532900314"}},"outputId":"0263a270-be5e-4f13-f738-5fc1e9d7057d"},"source":["%%time \n","\n","num_docs = tf_idf.shape[0]\n","weights = []\n","for i in range(num_clusters):\n","    # Compute the number of data points assigned to cluster i:\n","    num_assigned = (cluster_assignment == i).sum() # YOUR CODE HERE\n","    w = float(num_assigned) / num_docs\n","    weights.append(w)"],"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["CPU times: user 1.12 ms, sys: 12 µs, total: 1.13 ms\n","Wall time: 1.14 ms\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qlCCu9eu8NZo"},"source":["**Initializing covariances**\n","\n","To initialize our covariance parameters, we compute $\\hat{\\sigma}_{k, j}^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_{i,j} - \\hat{\\mu}_{k, j})^2$ for each feature $j$.
